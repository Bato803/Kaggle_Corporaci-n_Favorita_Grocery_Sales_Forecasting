### Kaggle Competition

For my MLND project, I did the [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting), Corporaci√≥n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting. This competition is trying to solve a regression problem, where we need to design a model to predict future sales of different products by learning from their previous sales record.
