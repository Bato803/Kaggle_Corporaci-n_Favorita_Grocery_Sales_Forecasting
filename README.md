# Sharpest-Mind

## Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

### Kaggle Competition

For my MLND project, I did the [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting), Corporaci√≥n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting. In this competition, we will be predicting the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores located in Ecuador.
